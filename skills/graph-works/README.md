Turn any LLM CLI into a disciplined wiki maintainer for your repo. graph-works works on any repo shape — single package, workspace-style monorepo (Turborepo / pnpm / Nx / Bazel / Cargo / Go workspaces), or a hybrid. It builds a code graph and renders one page per entity (repository, package, app, agent_plugin, dependency, test_suite) nested under `repositories/<repo>/`, plus `dependencies/<ecosystem>/<name>.md` for deps. The LLM walks your code, cross-references packages and concepts, ingests specs and articles and PRs, and keeps everything current as the code evolves.

## When to use

- Single-package libraries or services
- Monorepos (Turborepo, pnpm workspaces, Nx, Cargo workspaces, Go workspaces)
- Hybrid repos (a primary app plus loose internal libs, or mixed-language trees)
- Any repo where you want a compounding, cross-referenced wiki maintained alongside the code

## The idea in one paragraph

READMEs go stale. Architecture diagrams drift. Comments rot. This skill turns an LLM into a disciplined wiki maintainer that **reads the code**, **ingests your specs, PRs, and articles**, and **writes a persistent, interlinked Obsidian-compatible vault** alongside the repo. Every package has a summary page. Every decision has an ADR. Every ingested article gets filed and cross-linked. Linting detects **code drift** — packages added/renamed/deleted without the vault noticing. The vault compounds instead of rotting.

## What's in the box

| Piece | What it does |
|---|---|
| **SKILL.md** | Master skill — architecture, workflows, page categories, iron rules |
| **4 sub-agents** | `graph-works:scanner`, `graph-works:ingestor`, `graph-works:librarian`, `graph-works:linter` |
| **13 slash commands** | `/graph-works:onboard`, `/graph-works:scan`, `/graph-works:ingest`, `/graph-works:query`, `/graph-works:lint`, `/graph-works:log`, `/graph-works:file`, `/graph-works:archive`, `/graph-works:regen-index`, `/graph-works:status`, `/graph-works:next`, `/graph-works:proposals`, `/graph-works:auto-drive` |
| **Substrate operations** | Via `gw`: `bootstrap`, `scan`, `ingest`, `query`, `wiki lint` (+ code-drift) |
| **12 reference docs** | Schema, page formats, 4 workflows (scan/ingest/query/lint), Obsidian setup, cross-tool setup, monorepo principles, lifecycle rules, sidecar schema |
| **Wiki templates** | `CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `cursorrules`, `index.md`, `log.md`, plus entity templates (`entity-repository`, `entity-package`, `entity-app`, `entity-agent-plugin`, `entity-dependency`, `entity-test-suite`) and curated-page templates (`concept`, `concept-pattern`, `concept-architecture`, `source`, `adr`, `dependency`, `work`, `index`) |

## Quick start

```bash
# 1. Locate or create the workspace, then configure it (in Claude Code)
> /graph-works:onboard

# 2. Open the workspace in Obsidian (sidebar will show okf/ and its pages).
open -a Obsidian ~/my-repo/.works

# 3. Scan the repo — renders one page per admitted entity (package, app, dependency, …)
cd ~/my-repo
# in Claude Code:
> /graph-works:scan

# 4. Ingest a source (article, spec, PR summary) from anywhere on disk
> /graph-works:ingest ~/Downloads/auth-migration.md

# 5. Ask questions
> /graph-works:query "which packages depend on common-context-node-ts?"

# 6. Health check (mechanical + semantic + code drift)
> /graph-works:lint
```

## Page categories

| Category | Example |
|---|---|
| `app` | `<workspace>/okf/repositories/<repo>/apps/web-next-ts.md` — Next.js app: platform, routes, deployment |
| `package` | `<workspace>/okf/repositories/<repo>/packages/common-aws-node-ts.md` — Lambda handlers, middleware, exports |
| `concept` | `<workspace>/okf/concepts/global-context.md` — cross-cutting pattern; or `kind: architecture` for high-level syntheses, `kind: pattern` for reusable patterns |
| `dependency` | `<workspace>/okf/dependencies/npm/react.md` — external lib: versions in use, upgrade notes, gotchas (`kind: package | service`) |
| `source` | `<workspace>/okf/sources/2026-04-auth-migration-spec.md` — ingested spec with claims + citations |
| `adr` | `<workspace>/okf/adrs/0012-move-to-esm.md` — dated decision with context + consequences |

## Cross-tool compatibility

Only the schema loader file changes per tool. The scripts run identically everywhere.

| Tool | Loader file |
|---|---|
| Claude Code | `<workspace>/CLAUDE.md` |
| Codex CLI (OpenAI) | `<workspace>/AGENTS.md` |
| Cursor (modern) | `<workspace>/AGENTS.md` |
| Cursor (legacy) | `<workspace>/.cursorrules` |
| Antigravity (Google) | `<workspace>/AGENTS.md` |
| OpenCode / Pi | `<workspace>/AGENTS.md` |
| Gemini CLI | `<workspace>/AGENTS.md` |

`gw bootstrap` does not generate these loader files — author whichever ones your tools need. Your repo's root `CLAUDE.md` (build/lint conventions) and a workspace-level one (vault conventions) are independent.

├── workspace.yaml               # workspace manifest

    └── AGENTS.md                # same content for Codex/Cursor/Antigravity/OpenCode
```

**Iron rule:** the code is the source of truth. Ingested material is never edited — the ingest flow (either `gw ingest`'s `--backend bedrock`/`vercel` pipeline, or the `claude_code`-mode ingestor sub-agent per `/graph-works:ingest`) copies it into `<workspace>/okf/sources/references/`, leaving the original untouched; all curated writes go under `<workspace>/okf/`. Work items live at `<workspace>/okf/work/` and are referenced from other pages via wikilinks (e.g. `[[../work/release-healthkit/children/epic-reliability/children/bug-flaky-healthkit-tests]]`).

## Four operations

- **Scan** — build the code graph from the repo (`package.json`, `pnpm-workspace.yaml`, `pyproject.toml`, `Cargo.toml`, `go.mod`) and write/update/delete one page per admitted entity under `repositories/<repo>/` (or `dependencies/`); surface deletions for human review
- **Ingest** — read a source, discuss with user, write summary, update 5-15 cross-referenced pages, update index, log
- **Query** — index-first read, drill into 3-10 pages, synthesize with inline citations, offer to re-file the answer
- **Lint** — mechanical checks (orphans, broken links, stale pages, missing frontmatter) + semantic checks (contradictions, cross-reference gaps) + **code-drift** (packages on disk vs. in vault)

## Why not just maintain READMEs?

| READMEs | Code Wiki |
|---|---|
| One per package, manually written | One per package, LLM-maintained and cross-linked |
| Go stale silently | `lint` detects drift mechanically |
| No cross-references | Every package links to concepts, sources, ADRs |
| No history of why decisions were made | ADRs capture decisions; log tracks every ingest/scan |
| Specs and articles live elsewhere | Ingested directly from any path and summarized in `sources/` |
