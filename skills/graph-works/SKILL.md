# Code Wiki — Maintained Documentation Alongside Any Source-Code Project

Adapts the LLM Wiki pattern ([graph-works](../graph-works/SKILL.md); Karpathy's [gist](https://gist.github.com/karpathy/442a6bf555914893e9891c11519de94f)) to a source code monorepo. The LLM incrementally builds and maintains a persistent, interlinked markdown vault that documents every package, app, and cross-cutting concept in the repo — plus ingested specs, PR summaries, articles, and design notes.

## Core principle

Code comments go stale. README files rot. Architecture diagrams drift from reality. The wiki is **compounding, cross-referenced, and kept current** — sources (code, specs, PRs, articles) are read once and integrated into package summaries, ADRs, and architecture syntheses. Every claim links to a source; contradictions with newer code get flagged; the index stays in sync with what the repo actually looks like.

> Obsidian is the reading room. The LLM is the maintainer. Your repo is the source of truth.

## When to use

- **Single-package repos** — libraries, services, or apps where a README isn't enough and you want per-module/area pages
- **Monorepos** — Turborepo, pnpm workspaces, Nx, Bazel, Rush, Lerna, Go workspaces, Cargo workspaces
- **Hybrid repos** — a primary package at the root with nested apps/packages
- **Onboarding** — a wiki that an LLM keeps up to date reduces the cost of new contributors (human or agent)
- **Agent-assisted development** — coding agents read the vault before making edits; they edit the vault as they go
- **Architecture bookkeeping** — ADRs, cross-package conventions, deprecation notices, migration plans
- **Spec/PR/article ingestion** — you clip an article, write a spec, review a PR — all feed into the vault

**Do NOT use when:** the team has a documentation CMS they prefer, or nobody will curate ingestion (vault quality = source quality).

## Architecture

The wiki lives inside the graph-works workspace at `<workspace>/wiki/`. `gw` resolves the workspace from the `GRAPH_WORKS_DIR` env var — the supported pointer, normally injected via the `env` block of the `.claude/settings.local.json` belonging to whichever directory the session runs from; there is no workspace-path key inside `workspace.yaml` itself. Without it, resolution falls back to `<repo>/graph-works/` via a `.git` walk-up (it never searches for a `workspace.yaml`), so a workspace kept anywhere else needs the env var or an explicit `--workspace`. The Obsidian vault opens at `<workspace>/`, so `raw/` (external-source inbox — articles, specs, PRs, tickets dropped in for ingest; ingested sources move to `raw/_archive/`) is a sibling of `wiki/`, owned by `gw`. `work/` (unified work tracker — each item's page plus a per-item `work/<slug>/` working directory collecting its spec, plan, guidance bundles, and transcripts as it moves through the pipeline) lives at `<workspace>/wiki/work/` — nested under `wiki/`, not a workspace-root sibling, so `[[work/foo]]` wikilinks resolve against the same vault-relative base as `[[concepts/foo]]`; schema owned by `gw`, lifecycle owned by this plugin.

```

Every workspace package and app — plus the repository, external dependencies, and test suites — is rendered as a single page under `entities/`, named `<prefix>_<name>[__hex].md` (prefixes: `repo_`, `pkg_`, `app_`, `agent-plugin_`, `dep_`, suite-kind-aware `unit_tests_`/`int_tests_`). There are no separate `apps/`/`packages/` page folders — the graph is the sole source for which entities exist.

**Source of truth is the code itself.** The wiki is a compiled layer above it. If the wiki disagrees with the code, the code wins — the wiki gets updated.

## Four core operations

1. **Scan** — build the code graph and render one page per admitted entity into `entities/`; the default scan then fills prose via a commit-gated **emit → fan-out → apply** pipeline (`## Narrative`, file/dir descriptions, `## Purpose`/`## Public API`). A bare `--no-narrate` invocation is the mechanical structural-only fast path (`## Narrative` placeholder + `— TODO` file-map rows). See `references/scan-workflow.md`.
2. **Ingest** — read a source from `raw/` (article, spec, PR, transcript), discuss takeaways, write a source summary, update 5-15 relevant pages, update index, append to log. PDF/DOCX support is deferred — see `references/ingest-workflow.md` "Future formats". See `references/ingest-workflow.md`.
3. **Query** — read `index.md`, drill into 3-10 pages, synthesize with inline `[[wikilinks]]`, offer to file the answer back. See `references/query-workflow.md`.
4. **Lint** — health check including **code-drift detection**: packages on disk missing from the vault, vault pages referencing deleted/renamed packages, stale package summaries whose exports have changed. See `references/lint-workflow.md`.

## Quick start

```bash
# 1. Initialize a wiki in the resolved graph-works workspace.
#    Workspace and repo root are discovered via gw (walks up from cwd
#    for .git, reads workspace.yaml, defaults to <repo>/graph-works).
#    Wiki is created at <workspace>/wiki/ (e.g. graph-works/wiki/).
gw bootstrap --topic "<topic>" --tool all

# 2. Scan the repo to render one entities/ page per admitted entity
/graph-works:scan

# 3. Drop a source (article, spec, PR) into raw/ and ingest
/graph-works:ingest raw/specs/auth-migration.md

# 4. Ask questions
/graph-works:query "which packages depend on common-context-node-ts?"

# 5. Health check (surfaces code-drift too)
/graph-works:lint
```

## Slash commands

| Command | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `/graph-works:bootstrap` | Bootstrap a fresh wiki at `<workspace>/wiki/` (workspace resolved via `gw`, defaults to `<repo>/graph-works/`) |
| `/graph-works:scan` | Build the code graph; create/update/delete one `entities/` page per admitted entity |
| `/graph-works:ingest <path>` | Read a source from `raw/`, discuss, update vault, log it |
| `/graph-works:query <question>` | Search vault, synthesize answer with citations, offer to file back |
| `/graph-works:lint` | Health check — orphans, broken links, stale claims, **code drift**, and 32 work-layer lint rules |
| `/graph-works:log` | Show recent log entries (uses unix tools on `log.md`) |
| `/graph-works:file` | Interactively file a new work item (`gw work file`) |
| `/graph-works:archive` | Archive terminal-status work items (`gw work archive`) |
| `/graph-works:regen-index` | Rebuild `wiki/work-index.json` from `wiki/work/*.md` |

| `/graph-works:gate-check` | Run the user-gate "do I know HOW?" self-check and capture verification evidence |
| `/graph-works:specify-gate` | Lock down verification mechanics for an ambiguous user-gate task |

## Sub-agents

| Agent | When dispatched |
|---|---|
| `graph-works:scanner` | Build the code graph; write/update/delete one `entities/` page per admitted entity |
| `graph-works:ingestor` | Delegated ingest flow — reads source, proposes updates, applies after approval |
| `graph-works:linter` | Runs the health-check workflow (mechanical + semantic + code drift) |
| `graph-works:librarian` | Answers queries using index-first search with citations |

## Cross-tool compatibility

Every substrate operation goes through the `gw` CLI — one boundary, no in-process imports. Run `gw <verb> --help` for flags. The full set of verbs this skill and its commands depend on is the CLI contract at `wiki/concepts/graph-works-plugin-cli-contract.md`.

Schema lives in `<workspace>/wiki/CLAUDE.md` (Claude Code) or `<workspace>/wiki/AGENTS.md` (Codex/Cursor/Antigravity/OpenCode). The plugin ships both. The `gw` CLI runs identically everywhere. See `references/cross-tool-setup.md`.

**Note:** your repo's root `CLAUDE.md` is separate from the wiki's `CLAUDE.md`. The root file defines the repo's build/style conventions; the wiki file defines how the vault is structured. Both are active simultaneously when working from the repo root.

## Page categories

| Category | What it documents | Directory |
|---|---|---|
| `app` | One application workspace (web, mobile, CLI) — platform, entry points, deployment | `<workspace>/wiki/entities/app_<name>.md` |
| `package` | One library/service workspace — what it exports, who depends on it, key patterns | `<workspace>/wiki/entities/pkg_<name>.md` |
| `concept` | Cross-cutting technical idea, pattern, or architecture synthesis. Optional `kind:` frontmatter — `concept` (default), `pattern`, or `architecture` — selects the page template. Comparisons (`<a>-vs-<b>.md`) live here too. | `<workspace>/wiki/concepts/` |
| `dependency` | An external package or service the monorepo depends on — `kind:` discriminates | `<workspace>/wiki/entities/dep_<name>.md` |
| `source` | Summary of an ingested spec, PR, article, transcript, etc. | `<workspace>/wiki/sources/` |
| `adr` | Architecture Decision Record — a dated, citable decision with context + consequences | `<workspace>/wiki/adrs/` |

## Why this works (vs. just READMEs or generic docs)

| READMEs / generic docs | Code Wiki |
|---|---|
| Written once, go stale | Incrementally updated on every ingest/scan |
| One-directional (README describes package) | Bidirectional — packages link to concepts link to ADRs link to sources |
| Updates are manual chores | LLM does the cross-reference maintenance |
| Drift is invisible until you read | Lint surfaces drift mechanically |
| Searchable only by file | Indexed by category + frontmatter + BM25 |
| Specs/PRs/articles live in separate systems | Ingested and linked alongside code documentation |

- `page-templates/` — graph-derived entity templates (`entity-repository.md`, `entity-package.md`, `entity-app.md`, `entity-agent-plugin.md`, `entity-dependency.md`, `entity-test-suite.md`) plus curated-page templates (`concept.md`, `concept-pattern.md`, `concept-architecture.md`, `source.md`, `adr.md`, `dependency.md`, `work.md`, `index.md`)

## Iron rules

1. **The code is the source of truth.** If the vault contradicts the code, the code wins — update the vault.
2. **The LLM never edits file contents in `raw/`.** The only permitted `raw/` write is the post-ingest move to `raw/_archive/<same relative path>`.
3. **All LLM writes for the wiki go under `<workspace>/wiki/`.** Work items go to `<workspace>/wiki/work/` (owned by `gw`); ingested sources are archived under `<workspace>/raw/_archive/`.
4. **Every vault page has YAML frontmatter.** Curated pages (concept/source/adr/dependency/work) carry `title`, `category`, `summary`, `updated`; concept pages may also carry `kind: concept | pattern | architecture`; graph-derived `entities/` pages carry `uri`, `kind`, `graph_name`, `last_scan_at` plus per-kind edge/attr keys (the scanner owns their frontmatter) — `title`/`updated` are intentionally absent; the H1 carries the entity name and `last_scan_at` is the freshness signal.
5. **Every ingest or scan touches ≥3 files:** the changed/new page(s), `index.md`, `log.md`.
6. **Every claim on a package page cites** either a source page (`[[sources/xxx]]`) or a code path (`packages/foo/src/bar.ts`).
7. **Good query answers get filed back** — explorations compound.
