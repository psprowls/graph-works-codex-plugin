description: Use when driving a work item through its development pipeline — runs `gw work next` to compute the stage, dispatches the stage skill (brainstorming, reconciling-spec, epic-design, systematic-debugging, writing-plans, planning-epics, subagent-driven-development, test-driven-development, finishing-a-development-branch), verifies the artifact, and advances the item with `gw work advance`. One stage per invocation; clear context between stages. Pass `--descend` to auto-continue into the next actionable child leaf when an epic is waiting on children.

# Work Item Workflow

Dispatch one pipeline stage for a work item, then advance it. The CLI owns every
decision (routing, transitions, validation); this skill only relays.

**One stage per invocation, by design.** Never chain stages in a session — each
stage gets a fresh context window. The work item plus its owned `references/` artifacts are the
durable state between sessions; nothing depends on conversation memory.

**Invariant:** a work item's canonical path — and its
`<workspace>/okf/<work-path>/` owned directory — always exists before any spec
or plan is written. `gw work file` creates the owned directory at filing time. Brainstorming's auto-file mode enforces this
for standalone invocations; every stage dispatched from this pipeline assumes
it already holds.

The workspace doc-routing hook injects the resolved absolute workspace path into your context — use it if present when you see `<workspace>` mentioned in a command or instruction.

`gw` being on PATH doesn't prove it's this repo's build — a stale entry point can
own the name. Verify identity, not presence: `gw util describe-surface --json
>/dev/null 2>&1 || echo "gw is not graph-works-cli — use: uv run --package
graph-works-cli gw …"`.

## Steps

### 1. Resolve & report

Run `gw next <work-path> --json`.

`gw next` wraps the read-only `gw work next` and adds two keys to the JSON:
`guidance` (ranked phase-relevant pages) and `guidance_warnings`. `--file`
defaults to `"auto"`, which resolves beneath the item’s owned directory
and writes the assembled guidance bodies there when any matched; pass an
explicit `--file <work-path>` to override, or `--file ""` to skip writing entirely.
The parent dir is created on demand. The resolved (or skipped) target comes
back in the JSON's `guidance_file` key. `gw work next` itself may also return
`normalized` — a list of persisted managed-source repairs, each carrying the
canonical item `path`, canonical `source_id` (`design`), and root-absolute
`resource`; `null` means no source was repaired. A `--descend` repair may list
both the requested ancestor and selected leaf. Relay each entry to the user
like any other CLI finding: it
is the one write `gw work next` performs, and it is reported precisely so it
is never silent. All the blocker / terminal / dispatch fields the steps below
read are unchanged from `gw work next`.

- If `blockers` is non-empty:
  - If a blocker reports a **terminal status** (`resolved`, `wontfix`, or
    `superseded`) or **`phase=done`**, run **Terminal handling** (below): the
    pipeline is finished and the remaining work is ingest + archive.
  - Otherwise report each blocker and **stop** — *except* the **effort-required**
    blocker and the **"waiting on children"** blocker, which are handled by the
    dedicated bullets below (a non-null `on_complete` with empty `blockers` is the
    separate **satisfied gate**, also below). Do not improvise around `mitigated`
    items, invalid enums, or unknown paths — these are human decisions.
- If the only blocker says **effort required**: ask the user to size the item
  (xtra-small / small / medium / large / xtra-large — xtra-small/small means a bug-like item skips the planning stage),
  then run `gw work advance <work-path> --effort <value>` and re-run `gw work next`.
- If `action.skill` is **null**, `blockers` is empty, and `on_complete` is
  **non-null** — this is a **satisfied gate** (an epic whose children are all
  terminal, or an epic whose finish stage is satisfied). Do not dispatch a
  skill: run `gw work advance <work-path>` directly (step 5) — its own terminal
  check governs what happens next (Terminal handling if the advance lands on
  `phase: done` / `work_status: resolved`, otherwise the step 6 hand-off).
- If `action.skill` is **null** and a blocker says **"waiting on children"** —
  the epic's execute gate is unsatisfied. If the invocation carried `--descend`
  (or the user asks to auto-continue), re-run `gw next <work-path> --json --descend`:
  the JSON now describes the next actionable *leaf* in `selected_path`, with
  the chain in `descent.path`. Announce the descent path, then drive the leaf
  through the normal steps — dispatch transition, stage skill, advance — all
  against the leaf path. If the descend itself reports a `--descend:` blocker,
  or no `--descend` was requested, report the blocker, list the open children
  from `child_rollup.open_paths` suggesting `/gw:workflow <child-path>` for
  each, and **stop** (nothing to advance).
- Otherwise announce the dispatch: item title, kind, phase, and the stage skill
  from `action.skill`.

### 2. Apply the dispatch transition (when present)

If the JSON carries a non-null `on_dispatch`, apply it mechanically **before**
dispatching: run `gw work advance <work-path>`, supplying any flag named in
`on_dispatch.requires` (e.g. `--owner <handle>` when dispatching execution —
ask the user if no owner is known). Do not special-case stages; the CLI encodes
which transitions happen at dispatch time.

### 3. Dispatch the stage skill

Invoke the stage skill named by `action.skill` via the Skill tool, using the
value **verbatim**, prepending a work-item brief.

`action.skill` is the complete name. A qualified `<plugin>:<skill>` is passed
as-is; a bare name is passed as-is and resolves to a user-level or repo-local
skill. **Never prepend a namespace** — there is no implicit plugin, and
prefixing a qualified name produces a name that resolves to nothing.

**Preflight — confirm the skill resolves.** Before invoking, check that the
name you are about to invoke — `action.skill`, used verbatim — appears in
this harness's available-skills listing. If it does not, **stop** and report
that name, and, when it is qualified (`<plugin>:<skill>`), the plugin that is
missing. Do not substitute a similar skill, and do not perform the stage
yourself. This applies to bare and qualified names alike: a bare name is a
valid configured value, so checking only qualified ones would leave exactly
that case unguarded.

**Auto-drive relay override.** If `action.skill`'s **last segment** — the part
after the colon in a qualified `superpowers:finishing-a-development-branch` — is
`finishing-a-development-branch`, **and** the dispatch prompt that launched
this session contains an `Auto-drive context:` line, dispatch
`gw:finishing-relay` instead of the configured skill —
the merge target is already embedded in that same line, so no extra
forwarding is needed beyond the standard work-item brief below. This
override needs no STOP line: `finishing-relay` doesn't self-chain into
another stage, same as the stock skill it replaces.

- title, kind, summary, `affects`, and effort from the item's frontmatter
- links to the canonical `design` and `plan` entries in `sources[]` so the
  stage starts from durable artifacts, not from memory
- when `artifact.path` is set: "Write your output document to
  `<artifact.path>` — this overrides the skill's default location."
- when the `gw next` output's `guidance` list is non-empty, add a
  `## Relevant guidance` block to the brief pointing the stage skill at the
  assembled bundle:

  ```
  ## Relevant guidance
  Phase-relevant guidance assembled at: <guidance_file value from gw next's JSON output>
  Read it before starting this stage.
  ```

  Omit this block entirely when `guidance` is empty (guidance skipped or no
  matches). Surface any `guidance_warnings` to the user as plain notes.
- **Stage directives (riders).** Look `action.skill` up in the rider table
  below, keyed on its **last segment** — the part after the colon in a qualified
  `superpowers:brainstorming`. If a rider exists, open
  `references/brief-riders.md`, find the matching `## Rider: <name>` section, and
  inline its **Rider** block into the brief **verbatim**, under a
  `## Stage directives` heading. A rider is not a summary and not optional: the
  stage skill is stock and cannot be patched, so the rider text *is* the
  behavior. If `action.skill` has no rider, add nothing.

  Substitute `<workspace>` with the resolved absolute workspace path and
  `<work-path>` with the item's canonical path. Where a section documents a
  **Conditional clause**, apply its condition against the item's frontmatter and
  omit the clause when the condition does not hold.

  The STOP lines live in this table too. Omitting one lets the stage skill
  self-chain into the next stage, collapsing two stages into one session.

<!-- rider-table:start -->

| Skill | Stage | Carries |
|---|---|---|
| `brainstorming` | design | `--project-dir <workspace>` for the visual companion, plus the spec STOP line |
| `systematic-debugging` | design (bug) | A self-sufficient stop before stock Phase 4 (implementation) |
| `writing-plans` | plan | A self-sufficient Execution-Handoff stop |
| `planning-epics` | plan (epic) | Its STOP line |
| `subagent-driven-development` | execute | Positive authorization + mandatory isolation |
| `test-driven-development` | execute | Positive authorization + mandatory isolation |
| `finishing-a-development-branch` | finish | The on-trunk two-option menu |

<!-- rider-table:end -->

  `reconciling-spec`, `epic-design` and `finishing-relay` have no rider — they
  are ours and carry their behavior in their own files. Whether any other stage
  needs a rider is decided by one question, asked of the stock skill: does it
  run past the stage boundary?

The stock skills honor user-preference path overrides; they stay unmodified.

### 4. Verify the artifact

When `artifact.path` is set, check the file exists after the stage completes.
The brainstorming and writing-plans skills' own stock locations are already
the pipeline path — `<work-path>/references/01-design.md` and `02-plan.md`
respectively — the same path `artifact.path` points to, so the file should
already be there. If the skill instead wrote elsewhere, move the file to
`artifact.path` and say so.

### 5. Advance

Run `gw work advance <work-path>` with whatever flags the stage produced
(`--effort` if the command demands it, `--resolved-in <ref>` when completing
the finish stage). Report the lint findings it returns — they are the item's
health check, not noise. If the command errors with *effort required*, ask the
user to size the item as in step 1 — never pick an effort yourself — then retry.

**Relay no-advance outcomes.** If the just-completed stage was
`gw:finishing-relay`, skip this step's own `gw work advance` call
entirely for **every** relay outcome, including `merge` — the relay skill
already settled the item's state: for `merge`, its own R5 step already ran
`gw work advance <work-path> --resolved-in <ref>`; for `pr`/`hold`/`discard`, R5
deliberately chose not to advance. Calling `gw work advance` again here for
the `merge` outcome would double-advance an already-advanced item and error.
Because step 5 isn't calling advance itself in the `merge` case, it won't
naturally observe a `phase: done` / `work_status: resolved` landing either — to
decide whether **Terminal handling** applies, check the item's resulting
state directly (re-run `gw work next <work-path> --json`, or trust relay's own
`worker_done` report) instead of relying on this step's advance call to
surface it. For the `pr`/`hold`/`discard` outcomes the item deliberately
stays at `phase: finish`, so skip Terminal handling and go straight to step
6 — but see step 6's carve-out below before using its stock hand-off text.

If the advance lands the item at `phase: done` and `work_status: resolved`, run
**Terminal handling** (below) instead of the step 6 hand-off.

### 6. Hand off

End with: "Phase advanced to `<phase>`. Clear context (`/clear`) and run
`/gw:workflow <work-path>` to continue."

**Relay no-advance hand-off.** For a `gw:finishing-relay` stage that
reported `pr`, `hold`, or `discard`, the stock hand-off text above is wrong —
nothing advanced. Say instead: "`<work-path>` stays at `phase: finish` pending an
attended pass (relay outcome: `<pr|hold|discard>`). Clear context (`/clear`)
and run `/gw:workflow <work-path>` when ready to continue attended."

(Items that have reached a terminal state are handled by **Terminal handling**
below, not this hand-off.)

### Terminal handling

Run this when an item has reached a terminal state — either `gw work advance`
just landed it at `phase: done` / `work_status: resolved` (step 5), or `gw work next`
reported a terminal-status / `phase=done` blocker (step 1). This is post-pipeline
cleanup, not a pipeline stage — run it inline (it does not get its own fresh
context window).

1. **Ingest the design (resolved only).** If `work_status` is `resolved`, read
   `<workspace>/okf/<work-path>.md` and find the `sources[]` entry with
   `id: design`. If its root-absolute `resource` resolves beneath the OKF
   bundle, dispatch the ingest skill (`gw:ingest`) on that artifact inline; the ingestor runs its own
   confirmation dialog and, on success, archives the source and repoints the
   pointer. Skip the ingest (announce "no design to ingest") when `work_status` is
   `wontfix`/`superseded`, when no `design` source exists, or when the resource is already gone
   (already ingested). Ingest accepts design sources only — never hand it a
   plan artifact.

2. **Offer to archive (any terminal status).** Ask the user "Archive `<work-path>`
   now?" If yes, run `/gw:archive <work-path>`. If no, report that the item
   stays in `work/` and can be archived later with `/gw:archive`.

### Detaching a child

When `gw work advance <work-path>` refuses with *"waiting on children"*, either
finish the children (`gw next <work-path> --descend`) or explicitly move a
complete child subtree with `gw work reparent <child-path> --parent
<new-parent-path>`. Physical placement is ownership; do not add a hierarchy
field to frontmatter.
