# --- (e) parity with graph_works_core.workspace.discovery.resolve_root ----
#
# This script is a second implementation of a discovery chain that also exists
# in Python, and two implementations of one rule drift. The matrix below is the
# price of having them: it pins the relationship between the two rather than
# testing either alone.
#
# The relationship is not equality, because the two answer slightly different
# questions. `resolve_root` returns the *prospective* root and never checks
# whether it exists; this script declines to name a directory that is not
# there. So:
#
#   - when this script emits a path, `resolve_root` returns the same path;
#   - when it emits nothing, `resolve_root`'s answer is not a directory.
#
# Two documented divergences keep the matrix honest and are excluded from it
# rather than papered over:
#
#   - The single argument is overloaded here — an explicit workspace when it
#     is marked, a start directory otherwise — where Python takes `workspace`
#     and `cwd` separately. Each row therefore states which Python parameter
#     its argument corresponds to.
#   - `GRAPH_WORKS_DIR` is echoed verbatim here and `expanduser().resolve()`d
#     in Python. The matrix uses already-absolute, already-resolved values, so
#     a row that disagrees is real drift and not that.
#
# `uv` is a hard requirement, not a conditional skip: this suite runs from the
# checkout, and a gate that silently skips reports green while covering nothing.
